# Only Coders Full Stack Developer Coding Test

Welcome to my Full Stack Developer Coding Test directory! This test assesses my JavaScript development skills through three levels of tasks.

## Test Levels

### Level 1

In the `level1` directory, I've showcased my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6) to create a sample webpage. I paid close attention to detail and ensured it's mobile-friendly.

#### Requirements:

- Accurate representation of the design.
- Mobile-friendly design.
- Implementation of animations using JavaScript.
- Bonus Points:
  - Bootstrap integration.
  - ReactJS integration.

### Bonus Level 2

To handle this level in the `level2` directory, I created a simple form with email, password, and confirm password fields. This form collects user information and sends it to the backend for validation. If the information is valid, the backend returns a success message; otherwise, it displays an error message.

#### Requirements:

- Create a form component.
- Set up form submission handling.
- Implement front-end validation.
- Make an API call to the backend.
- Validate the received data in the backend.
- Display the success or error message on the frontend.

### Bonus Level 3

In the `level3` directory, I demonstrated my knowledge of MongoDB by storing email and password data received from the form.
