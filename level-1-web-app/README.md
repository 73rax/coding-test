# Coding Test: Level 1

## Overview

This project is designed to showcase proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). The goal is to create a sample webpage based on the attached design, paying attention to detail, ensuring mobile-friendliness, and incorporating nice animations using JavaScript. As an added bonus, I choose to integrate and utilize ReactJS for a modern JavaScript framework.

## Features

- **Accurate Design:** Pay close attention to detail, spacing, typography, and alignment to create a polished and professional appearance.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Ensure that the webpage is responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes and orientations.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS

- ReactJS

## Getting started

Ensure you are in the project's directory

- Install all dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
```

- Then run the following to start the app

```bash
npm start
```

## Bonus Points

- **Libraries Integration:** I have used the library Date-fns for a conveniant way to calculate timestamps and accurately display them on the application. Furthermore, I have used MUI Base UI to design the header's dropdowns but I have also designed a dropdown withought the libraries showcasing competency with and without libraries.

- **ReactJS Integration:** By integrating ReactJS I have showcased my competency on using a framework to rapidly produce an web application. By harnessing the component based architecture I have incresed the scalability of the application and its readability.

## Best Practices

- I have used appropriate semantic HTML5 to give meaning on the structure of my web application. That way I have enhance code clarity for developers, increase accesibility and enchance readability.

- Used CSS preprocessor SASS as well as used BEM classes to write more maintainable and organised CSS code.

- Optimised assets by minimising the size of images and styles to improve page load times.

- Used JavaScript best practices by using modern JavaScript (ES6+) features. Followed consistent naming convention for variables and functions.
